scopefocus Meastro CoverCalibrator Driver (first attempt) 

determine open and closed angle as previously discussed
Set cover settle time to about 3 sec (time it takes for flap to change state)
Set Calib settle time to about 2 sec (time it takes for level servo to change ) 
[ote both above are over estimeates...futere versions may try to optimize these times]

If you do not have a servoe to change the EL panel level potentiometer, then you must enter 1 for Max Brightness
otherwise set to 180 (this represents the degrees the potentiometer turns) it is not a true brightness level.
